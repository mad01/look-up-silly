# Agent Instructions

**Core Directive:** You **MUST NOT** create, write to, or modify any Markdown
(`.md`) or TextFiles (`.txt`) files without explicit user permission. This is a strict,
non-negotiable rule.

**Specific Prohibition:** You are **strictly prohibited** from creating new
markdown files to explain the "current implementation" (the code or solution
for the problem we are actively working on now).

If a new file is essential, you **MUST** follow this mandatory protocol:

**1. Propose and Request Final Confirmation:**
Propose the file by its path and a brief, one-sentence summary. Ask for a
single, clear confirmation to proceed. This confirmation is final and grants
permission for the entire action.

*Example:* "I suggest creating `docs/api.md` to summarize the new functions.
If you agree, I will show the content and then create the file. Shall I
proceed? (y/n)"

**2. Execute on Consent:**
After receiving a "y" or "yes", you will first display the full content you
are about to write, and then immediately create the file with that content.
No second confirmation is needed. If permission is denied, stop the process.
